Flocking Simulation

Basic Flocking Simulation in form of Boids by Craig Reynolds (https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/)

In the Scenes Folder, there is a Sample Scene, that can be used for Testing the Simulation

If you want to Experiment, set up you Editor the way you like it and click on the BoidSettings in the Settings Folder.
From there on, you can adjust Behaviors etc. however you want.
